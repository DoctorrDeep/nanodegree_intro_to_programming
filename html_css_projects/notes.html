        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> make a repo</li>
            <li> save file as </li>
            <li> Some abbreviations: 
                <ol style="color:purple;font-size:large">
                    <li><strong>HTML</strong> is <em>HyperText Markup Language</em>
                    <li> <strong>HTTP</strong> is <em>HyperText Transfer protocol</em>
                    <li> <strong>URL</strong> is <em>Uniform Resource Locator</em>
                    <li> <strong>href</strong> is <em>Hypertext REFerence</em>
                    <li> <strong>DOM</strong> is <em>Document Object Model</em>
                    <li> <strong>CSS</strong> is <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>
                </ol></li>
            <li> Make a change in the html file. <em>Only</em> refesh shows the update</li>
            <li> servers and computers are almost the same</li>
            <li> html files are text files that servers serve to users visiting a website on their web-browser</li>
            <li> links in the file can point to files in any server or its own web server</li>
            <li> Optional closing tags: li and p (did not know about p)</li>
            <li> For the above the browser assumes when it encounters the next li or p that a new line-item or new paragraph has started!</li>
            <li> These items cannot be nested, hence it is safe for a browser to assume so.</li>
            <li> Diff kinds of URLs. Fully qualified URL have <mark>http://</mark>,<mark>https://</mark>,<mark>file://</mark> prefix</li>
            <li> Links to other pages or files is done with the help of the a-tag which stands for anchor Example <a href="https://udacity.com/"> <strong>Udacity</strong> webpage</a></li>
            <li> HTML files (modern ones) need 3 sections. if they are not explicitly mentioned, the rules must be followed</li>
            <li> Teh browser will will fill in the blanks and expect the right things ion the correct location</li>
            <li> First things first... the Doctype: meant to simplify how the browser interpret the version of HTML being used</li>
            <li> Next, the head! It contains title, style guidelines and any scripting that applies to the whole page</li>
            <li> lastly the body whic contains the content of what the website visitor is seeing in the broser and clicking on.</li>
            <li> the head and body is inside the html tag which can also have attributes like language (Needed by things like text-to-speech programs) </li>
            <li> 96 pixels(px) is 1 inch <em>(Now you know)</em></li>
            <li> 72points(pt) (used in font sizing) is 1 inch <em>(Now you know)(Thank me later)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is <em>em</em>?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>the "em" and "/em" characters together within &lt;> is known as the emphasis tags</li>
            <li>Anything written within it is italicized like "<em>this</em>" as opposed to a normal this</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>What is <em>markup</em>?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Markup is what tells the browser to show text in s special way as instructed in that language</li>
            <li>See "<em>em</em>" above for an example</li>
        </ol>
