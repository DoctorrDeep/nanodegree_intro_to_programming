			<p class="description">Capybaras are herbivores, grazing mainly on grasses and aquatic plants, as well as
				fruit and tree bark.
				They are very selective feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species
				surrounding it. They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are
				available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during
				the dry season.</p>
